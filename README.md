# Hello Welcome To Query API
Before we get started you should download and install all **requirements** needed to run this api.

> #### Steps
> - Clone this repository
> - Then create a virtual environment using **py -m venv .venv**
> - Run that environment using **.venv\scripts\activate**
> - After that install all the requirements using **pip install -r requirements.txt**
> - Finally run the development server using **uvicorn app.main:app --reload**

##### Notes
- Here *unvicorn* is the server we are running on
- *app* is the python module
- *main* is the file
- *:app* is the FastAPI() instance
- *--reload* is only used on development so we can see changes on save
- This project uses MS SQL SERVER. So, please install that or change DATABASE_URL
